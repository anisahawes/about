## Note on image optimizing

Landscape images should be max 1200px wide.
Portrait images should be max 700-800px wide. 

Use Photoshop 'Save for web' to reduce original size, or another app (even Preview should be able to do it).
Keep PNGs if you need transparency. Otherwise use JPGs for smaller sizes.
